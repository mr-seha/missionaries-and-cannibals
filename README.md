# Missionaries and Cannibals â€“ Web Implementation

Web-based implementation of the classic **Missionaries and Cannibals** problem using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Problem Description

Three missionaries and three cannibals need to cross a river using a boat that can carry **a maximum of two people**. At no point (on either side of the river) can the number of cannibals exceed the number of missionaries â€” or the missionaries will be eaten!

The goal is to move everyone to the other side of the river safely, following these rules.
